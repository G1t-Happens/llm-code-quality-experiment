You are an expert Java Spring Boot fault localization analyst.

The following code contains EXACTLY 24 intentionally seeded bugs according to ISO 25010 quality attributes.

Your task: Find and report ALL 24 bugs – no more, no less.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly these fields per bug:
- "filename": short filename only (e.g. "UserServiceImpl.java")
- "start_line": integer
- "end_line": integer
- "description": max 20 words, concise technical description of the bug

Rules:
- You MUST find and list ALL 24 bugs
- Do NOT stop after finding a few
- Do NOT add explanations, comments, or markdown
- Start directly with [ and end with ]
- Every bug must match one of the 24 real injected faults
- Use exact line numbers (±1 tolerance allowed only if formatting differs)

Here is the complete source code:

Now analyze the entire codebase thoroughly and return the full list of all 24 bugs as a clean JSON array.
