AddressController.java,44,47,"The create endpoint is restricted to requests with Content-Type text/plain even though it expects a JSON AddressRequest body, so standard application/json clients receive 415 Unsupported Media Type and cannot create addresses.",E007
AddressController.java,50,53,"The update endpoint does not annotate the payload with @Validated(Update.class); since all update constraints in AddressRequest belong to the Update group, this method performs no validation and accepts invalid/blank address data.",E009
UserController.java,47,51,"User creation lacks @Valid/@Validated(Create.class) on the request body, so none of the group-scoped constraints in UserRequest (username uniqueness, password strength, email format, etc.) are enforced.",E008
UserController.java,59,61,"The delete endpoint has no @PreAuthorize guard, allowing any authenticated user to delete arbitrary users despite other operations being restricted to admins/owners.",E015
AddressServiceImpl.java,65,69,getById invokes addressRepository.findById(...).get() without checking presence; a missing address causes NoSuchElementException (HTTP 500) instead of returning a controlled ResourceNotFoundException.,E012
AddressServiceImpl.java,80,89,"save() builds an Address entity and immediately maps it back to a DTO without ever calling addressRepository.save(...), so no database insert occurs and the returned response lacks a generated id.",E003
UserMapper.java,53,56,"updateUserEntityFromUserRequest encodes passwords with passwordEncoder.encode(passwordEncoder.encode(dto.password())), storing bcrypt(bcrypt(raw)) and making updated passwords impossible to verify during login.",E001
UserServiceImpl.java,73,80,"listAll ignores the supplied Pageable and loads every user via findAll(), so pagination metadata does not match the content and each call performs a full-table read regardless of requested page/size.",E004
UserServiceImpl.java,120,121,"The save method logs usernames together with the raw password string, leaking credentials into application logs and violating security best practices.",E014
UserServiceImpl.java,99,104,"getByUsername concatenates the username directly into a native SQL string (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + username + `'`), enabling SQL injection and bypassing parameter binding.",E013
UserServiceImpl.java,162,171,delete(Long id) loads the user but never calls userRepository.delete(...); the method reports success without removing anything from the database.,E002
UserServiceImpl.java,176,189,checkLogin calls userRepository.findByUsername(...).get() before validating credentials; when the username does not exist it throws NoSuchElementException (500) and the intended constant-time dummy hash/UnauthorizedException path is never executed.,E010
