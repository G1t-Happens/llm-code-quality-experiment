AddressController.java,44,48,"The create endpoint is restricted to requests with Content-Type text/plain even though it expects an AddressRequest JSON body. Standard application/json posts will be rejected with 415 Unsupported Media Type, preventing address creation.",E007
AddressController.java,50,53,"The update endpoint accepts AddressRequest without any @Valid/@Validated annotation, so the defined validation rules (e.g., not blank, sizes) never run during updates and invalid data hits the database.",E009
UserController.java,47,50,"User creation requests are not validated because the method parameter lacks @Valid/@Validated(Create.class). Required fields (username/password/email/admin) can be null or malformed, leading to constraint violations or inconsistent data.",E008
UserController.java,59,61,"The delete endpoint has no @PreAuthorize guard, so any authenticated principal (even a non-admin stranger) can delete arbitrary users because global security only enforces authentication.",E015
AddressServiceImpl.java,65,74,"getById() calls addressRepository.findById(...).get() without checking the Optional. When an address is missing a NoSuchElementException is thrown, producing a 500 instead of the intended ResourceNotFoundException (404).",E012
AddressServiceImpl.java,78,89,save() builds an Address entity but never persists it via addressRepository.save(...). The method returns a DTO for a transient entity with a null id and no row is inserted into the database.,E003
UserMapper.java,53,56,"updateUserEntityFromUserRequest encodes the new password twice (passwordEncoder.encode(passwordEncoder.encode(dto.password()))). Any password changed through this path will no longer match during login, locking the user out.",E001
UserServiceImpl.java,72,82,listAll(Pageable) ignores the pageable argument by calling userRepository.findAll() and returning the entire dataset as page content. Pagination and sorting parameters are silently ignored and large tables are loaded fully into memory.,E004
UserServiceImpl.java,100,104,"getByUsername constructs a native SQL string by concatenating the untrusted username (""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '"" + username + ""'""). This allows SQL injection.",E013
UserServiceImpl.java,117,132,"save() logs the plaintext password in ""user with name: {} and password: {}"", leaking credentials into application logs and violating security best practices.",E014
UserServiceImpl.java,164,173,delete() loads the user but never calls userRepository.delete(...). The API reports success although the record remains in the database.,E002
UserServiceImpl.java,175,189,checkLogin() immediately calls userRepository.findByUsername(...).get(); when the username is unknown this throws NoSuchElementException (500) and bypasses the intended dummy-hash timing protection instead of returning 401 Unauthorized.,E010
