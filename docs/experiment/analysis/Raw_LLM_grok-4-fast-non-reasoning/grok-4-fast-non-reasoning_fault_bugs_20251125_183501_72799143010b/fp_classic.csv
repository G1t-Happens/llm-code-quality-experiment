AddressServiceImpl.java,"(96, 100)","Inconsistent error handling in update method: Uses orElseThrow for address but logs error message with '<-- update', potentially misleading logs. Low-probability nonmalicious development fault (logging inconsistency), operational phase. Minor propagation to erratic logging, but aids fault diagnosis."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(139, 149)","Potential NPE in enforceAddressOwnership: Accesses address.getUser().getId() without null check on user (though LAZY fetch may proxy). Low-probability interaction fault (JPA lazy loading timing), operational phase. Could propagate to erratic failure if user detached."
UserRequest.java,"(22, 26)","Weak password validation: Regex allows passwords without special characters, below modern security standards. Medium-probability nonmalicious development fault (inadequate constraint), development phase. Propagates to security failure (weak credentials exploitable via brute-force)."
