AddressServiceImpl.java,"(86, 87)","Premature mapping in save method: Calls addressMapper.toAddressResponse before saving entity, returning unsaved ID (null) in response. Medium-probability nonmalicious development fault (timing error: mapping pre-persist), development phase. Leads to content failure (incorrect ID in response), confusing clients."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(96, 100)","Inconsistent error handling in update method: Uses orElseThrow for address but logs error message with '<-- update', potentially misleading logs. Low-probability nonmalicious development fault (logging inconsistency), operational phase. Minor propagation to erratic logging, but aids fault diagnosis."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(139, 149)","Potential NPE in enforceAddressOwnership: Accesses address.getUser().getId() without null check on user (though LAZY fetch may proxy). Low-probability interaction fault (JPA lazy loading timing), operational phase. Could propagate to erratic failure if user detached."
LoggingConfig.java,"(95, 137)","Race condition in initializeLogging: Synchronized but volatile flag may allow multiple initializations under concurrent startup. Medium-probability nonmalicious development fault (insufficient synchronization), operational phase. Potential erratic failure (duplicate appenders), low impact with Spring singleton."
UserRequest.java,"(22, 26)","Weak password validation: Regex allows passwords without special characters, below modern security standards. Medium-probability nonmalicious development fault (inadequate constraint), development phase. Propagates to security failure (weak credentials exploitable via brute-force)."
