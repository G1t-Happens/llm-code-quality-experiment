UserServiceImpl.java,"(126, 127)","Redundant PasswordEncoder instantiation in save: Creates new BCryptPasswordEncoder() instead of injecting shared instance, risking configuration inconsistencies (hypothesized nonmalicious development fault: unnecessary local creation vs. field injection, low probability but deviates from DI pattern)"
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(86, 87)","Premature mapping in save: toAddressEntity followed immediately by toAddressResponse on unsaved entity, returning generated ID=0 instead of actual database ID (hypothesized nonmalicious development fault: incorrect assumption about entity state post-mapping pre-save, medium probability as response lacks real ID until next query)"
LoggingConfig.java,"(209, 210)","Potential log injection in createRollingFileAppender: totalSizeCapStr parsed without validation, allowing malformed input to disrupt rolling policy (hypothesized external interaction fault: untrusted config value, low probability as it's application property but could be tampered in env)"
