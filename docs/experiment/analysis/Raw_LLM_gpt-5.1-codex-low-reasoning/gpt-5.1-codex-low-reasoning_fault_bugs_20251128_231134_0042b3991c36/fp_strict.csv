AddressServiceImpl.java,"(66, 74)","getById uses addressRepository.findById(...).get() without checking presence, which throws NoSuchElementException (500) instead of returning 404 when an address is absent."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(79, 89)","save() maps the DTO to an entity but never persists it via addressRepository.save, so no record is written to the database and the response lacks the generated ID."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(101, 113)","getByUsername builds a native query by concatenating the username directly into SQL, creating a SQL injection vulnerability."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(161, 173)","delete() loads the user but never calls userRepository.delete, so no deletion actually occurs."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(175, 189)","checkLogin() calls userRepository.findByUsername(username).get() without checking presence; if the user does not exist it throws NoSuchElementException before reaching the dummy hash logic, resulting in a 500 response instead of a controlled 401."
