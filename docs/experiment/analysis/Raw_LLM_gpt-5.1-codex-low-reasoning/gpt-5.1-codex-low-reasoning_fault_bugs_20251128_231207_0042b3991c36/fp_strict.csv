UserServiceImpl.java,"(66, 76)","listAll(Pageable) ignores the provided Pageable and loads all users into memory before wrapping them in a PageImpl, resulting in incorrect pagination metadata and potential performance issues on large datasets."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(94, 103)","getByUsername() builds a native SQL string by concatenating the username directly into the query, allowing SQL injection if a crafted username is supplied."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(113, 113)","save() logs the raw password in plaintext, which is a severe security vulnerability because credentials can leak through log files."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(162, 173)","delete() looks up the user but never invokes userRepository.delete(...), so the method reports success without removing the user from the database."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(176, 190)","checkLogin() calls userRepository.findByUsername(...).get() and only afterwards checks for null, causing NoSuchElementException/500 when the user does not exist instead of returning Unauthorized; the dummy hash logic is never reached."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(66, 74)","getById() calls addressRepository.findById(addressId).get() without handling empty Optional, leading to NoSuchElementException (500) instead of returning 404 when the address does not exist."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(79, 90)","save() maps the request to an Address entity but never persists it with addressRepository.save(), so no record is created in the database and the returned DTO contains a null id."
