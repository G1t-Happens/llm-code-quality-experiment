LoggingConfig.java,"(90, 138)","Race condition in initializeLogging: non-atomic 'initialized' check and set without proper synchronization in multi-threaded startup, potential multiple initializations; hypothesizing nonmalicious development fault (concurrency omission), low propagation to resource waste but affects dependability."
Address.java,"(105, 114)","Incomplete equals/hashCode: only considers id, ignoring other fields for business equality (e.g., duplicate addresses); hypothesizing nonmalicious development fault (shallow entity comparison), low propagation but risks inconsistency in collections."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(181, 186)","NullPointerException risk in checkLogin: userRepository.findByUsername(username).get() assumes non-null result without prior existence check, causing runtime error if user not found; hypothesizing nonmalicious development fault (incomplete error handling), medium propagation to erratic failure (500 errors), mitigated partially by dummy hash but still exposes NPE."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(96, 100)","Inconsistent error logging in update: LOG.error called inside orElseThrow lambda without execution guarantee if entity found, potentially missing logs; hypothesizing low-probability development fault (logging placement), low propagation but reduces dependability in operational phase."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(116, 120)","Repeated findById in delete: addressRepository.findById(addressId) without caching or batching, inefficient for high-load; hypothesizing nonmalicious development fault (performance omission), low propagation to timing failure under load."
