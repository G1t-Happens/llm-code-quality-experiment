UserServiceImpl.java,"(103, 104)",high,"Direct use of native SQL for user lookup in getByUsername() bypasses JPA and repository-level security, and disables automatic query parameterization, increasing risk of SQL injection and maintainability issues."
UserMapper.java,"(26, 27)",medium,"UserMapper.toUserEntity() hashes password even if null, which may result in encoding null and storing an invalid hash. Should check for null before encoding."
UserMapper.java,"(56, 56)",medium,"UserMapper.updateUserEntityFromUserRequest() double-encodes password, which is a major anti-pattern and breaks authentication. Also, does not check for null password before encoding."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(44, 46)",low,"DUMMY_HASH is hardcoded and may not match the actual password encoder configuration, reducing effectiveness of timing attack mitigation."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(119, 119)",low,"Logging user passwords in plain text in save() exposes sensitive information in logs, violating confidentiality and security best practices."
