E007,LoggingConfig.java,"(237, 237)",medium,"Appender and log level are set on ROOT_LOGGER, affecting all components and modules globally"
E008,LoggingConfig.java,"(96, 97)",high,"Sets the timezone globally for the entire JVM instead of only for the logger, potentially affecting other modules, libraries, and scheduling operations"
E010,UserController.java,"(47, 47)",high,"The create() endpoint does not validate the UserRequest DTO. Invalid input (e.g., missing required fields) can lead to a 500 Internal Server Error instead of a clear client-facing error"
E011,AddressRequest.java,"(23, 23)",low,someValue field in AddressRequest is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate its purpose. Frontend developers not know which data to provide
E012,AddressController.java,"(48, 48)",medium,"The update() Endpoint uses PUT, but business logic uses partial field updates. API is hard to use correctly and does not convey the intended behavior clearly to clients"
E014,SecurityConfig.java,"(107, 110)",critical,"Removing all validation in createSecretKey causes the entire Spring Boot application to fail to start (throwing an uncaught exception during context initialization) whenever jwt.secret is missing, empty, malformed, or too short"
E019,AddressController.java,"(21, 25)",low,"Tight coupling between controller and service. This creates tight coupling, making testing and swapping implementations harder"
E020,AddressServiceImpl.java,"(36, 36)",medium,"Using @Autowired field injection instead of constructor injection reduces testability, hides dependencies, and makes the class harder to instantiate manually or refactor"
E021,UserServiceImpl.java,"(206, 206)",low,"Method named 'do_Some_Stuff()' uses a vague, non-descriptive name that hides its intent, severely reducing code readability and analysability"
E022,LoggingConfig.java,"(54, 55)",high,"The default log file name contains characters valid on Linux but invalid on Windows (e.g., application:errors.log). This prevents installation/running on Windows"
E024,LoggingConfig.java,"(193, 193)",medium,Hardcoded file path separator may cause portability issues across different operating systems
