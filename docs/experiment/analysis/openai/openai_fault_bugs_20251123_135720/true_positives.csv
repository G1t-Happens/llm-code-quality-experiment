This is a nonmalicious development fault (omission: missing error handling).
E003,AddressServiceImpl.java,"(79, 91)","(87, 88)",critical,high,Missing save call in the repository/data access layer,"Address entity is created from AddressRequest and User, but not persisted (missing addressRepository.save(addressEntity)), so returned AddressResponse may have null id and address is not stored. Nonmalicious development fault (omission: missing persistence)."

Nonmalicious development fault (injection: unsafe query construction).

Nonmalicious development fault (omission: missing error handling).

Nonmalicious development fault (commission: logging secrets).

May cause login failures if encoders differ. Nonmalicious development fault (design inconsistency)."

Nonmalicious development fault (logic error: double hashing).
