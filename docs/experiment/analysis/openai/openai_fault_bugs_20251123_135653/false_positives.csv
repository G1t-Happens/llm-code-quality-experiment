SecurityExpressions.java,"(19, 23)",medium,"isOwner() compares resourceOwnerId.toString() to auth.getName(), which may not match if auth.getName() is username (not userId). This can allow privilege escalation or denial of access. Hypothesized nonmalicious development fault (logic error, authentication/authorization)."
SecurityConfig.java,"(82, 82)",medium,"JwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter uses 'scope' as authorities claim, but generated JWTs use 'scope' with values 'ADMIN' or 'USER' (not 'ROLE_ADMIN'/'ROLE_USER'). This may cause role-based access control to fail. Hypothesized nonmalicious development fault (configuration mismatch)."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(49, 63)",low,"Potential performance issue: listAll() loads User entity for every address listing, even if not used for authorization (already checked by @PreAuthorize). Hypothesized nonmalicious development fault (inefficiency)."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(180, 180)",low,"Null password in checkLogin: password is set to empty string if null, which may allow login attempts with blank passwords. Hypothesized nonmalicious development fault (input validation)."
UserMapper.java,"(26, 26)",low,No null check for dto.password() in toUserEntity: may throw NullPointerException if password is null. Hypothesized nonmalicious development fault (input validation).
UserMapper.java,"(55, 55)",low,No null check for dto.password() in updateUserEntityFromUserRequest: may throw NullPointerException if password is null. Hypothesized nonmalicious development fault (input validation).
UserServiceImpl.java,"(182, 185)",low,"DUMMY_HASH is used for timing attack prevention, but only if user is null. However, unchecked get() above will throw before this is reached. Hypothesized dormant logic fault (timing attack mitigation ineffective)."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(61, 61)",low,"jwtExpirationHours is loaded as long, but may be set to 0 or negative in configuration, causing tokens to never expire or be immediately expired. Hypothesized dormant configuration fault (input validation)."
SecurityConfig.java,"(51, 52)",low,"jwtSecret is injected from configuration, but no validation for length/entropy. Weak or short secrets may allow JWT forgery. Hypothesized dormant configuration fault (security)."
SecurityConfig.java,"(54, 55)",low,"apiBasePath is injected from configuration, but no validation for leading/trailing slashes or empty value. May cause endpoint misconfiguration. Hypothesized dormant configuration fault."
LoggingConfig.java,"(51, 51)",low,"Default log directory is hardcoded to '/home/dbe/projects/llm-code-quality-experiment/baseline_project/logs', which may not exist or be writable in production. Hypothesized dormant configuration fault (portability/permissions)."
