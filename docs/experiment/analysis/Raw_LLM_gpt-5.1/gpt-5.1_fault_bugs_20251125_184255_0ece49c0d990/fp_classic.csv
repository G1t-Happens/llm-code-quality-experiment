UserServiceImpl.java,"(205, 213)","createLoginResponse() and generateJwtToken() rely on injected jwtIssuer and jwtExpirationHours without validation; misconfiguration (e.g., negative expiration) could produce already-expired tokens. This is a latent configuration/validation fault that can cause intermittent authentication failures."
UserRequest.java,"(21, 26)","Password field is validated only for presence and complexity but not for leading/trailing whitespace or overall maximum length semantics; combined with logging in UserServiceImpl.save(), this increases risk of accidental sensitive-data exposure and inconsistent credential handling (latent design fault)."
SecurityConfig.java,"(60, 76)","SecurityFilterChain permits POST {api.base-path}/users for unauthenticated callers while UserController.create() allows setting the admin flag gated only by @sec.canSetAdminFlag, which relies on Authentication; for anonymous users auth is null, but the expression still allows admin=false. This design permits unrestricted self-registration as non-admin but, combined with other flaws (e.g., missing delete authorization), increases attack surface. Additionally, CSRF is fully disabled, which is acceptable for pure APIs but becomes a fault if used from browsers without proper token-based protection."
SecurityExpressions.java,"(18, 23)","isOwner(Long resourceOwnerId, Authentication auth) compares resourceOwnerId.toString() to auth.getName(), assuming the principal name equals the numeric user ID. If the Authentication implementation uses username as principal (default for many setups), this check will always fail, causing legitimate owners to be denied access (nonmalicious design fault in authorization logic)."
User.java,"(19, 20)","Password column is limited to length 60, which is tight for BCrypt hashes and may be incompatible with alternative encoders or configuration changes; this is a latent schema design fault that can cause truncation errors or authentication failures if encoder output length changes."
UserRepository.java,"(12, 15)",UserRepository lacks a method to check for email uniqueness despite email likely being a logical unique identifier; this omission is a latent design fault that can allow duplicate emails and complicate account recovery or identification flows.
