E007,AddressController,"(44, 48)","The create endpoint is restricted to requests with Content-Type text/plain even though it expects an AddressRequest JSON body. Standard application/json posts will be rejected with 415 Unsupported Media Type, preventing address creation."
E009,AddressController,"(50, 53)","The update endpoint accepts AddressRequest without any @Valid/@Validated annotation, so the defined validation rules (e.g., not blank, sizes) never run during updates and invalid data hits the database."
E008,UserController,"(47, 50)","User creation requests are not validated because the method parameter lacks @Valid/@Validated(Create.class). Required fields (username/password/email/admin) can be null or malformed, leading to constraint violations or inconsistent data."
E015,UserController,"(59, 61)","The delete endpoint has no @PreAuthorize guard, so any authenticated principal (even a non-admin stranger) can delete arbitrary users because global security only enforces authentication."
E012,AddressServiceImpl,"(65, 74)","getById() calls addressRepository.findById(...).get() without checking the Optional. When an address is missing a NoSuchElementException is thrown, producing a 500 instead of the intended ResourceNotFoundException (404)."
E003,AddressServiceImpl,"(78, 89)",save() builds an Address entity but never persists it via addressRepository.save(...). The method returns a DTO for a transient entity with a null id and no row is inserted into the database.
E001,UserMapper,"(53, 56)","updateUserEntityFromUserRequest encodes the new password twice (passwordEncoder.encode(passwordEncoder.encode(dto.password()))). Any password changed through this path will no longer match during login, locking the user out."
E004,UserServiceImpl,"(72, 82)",listAll(Pageable) ignores the pageable argument by calling userRepository.findAll() and returning the entire dataset as page content. Pagination and sorting parameters are silently ignored and large tables are loaded fully into memory.
E013,UserServiceImpl,"(100, 104)","getByUsername constructs a native SQL string by concatenating the untrusted username (""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '"" + username + ""'""). This allows SQL injection."
E014,UserServiceImpl,"(117, 132)","save() logs the plaintext password in ""user with name: {} and password: {}"", leaking credentials into application logs and violating security best practices."
E002,UserServiceImpl,"(164, 173)",delete() loads the user but never calls userRepository.delete(...). The API reports success although the record remains in the database.
E010,UserServiceImpl,"(175, 189)",checkLogin() immediately calls userRepository.findByUsername(...).get(); when the username is unknown this throws NoSuchElementException (500) and bypasses the intended dummy-hash timing protection instead of returning 401 Unauthorized.
