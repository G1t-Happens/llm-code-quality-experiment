AddressServiceImpl.java,"(67, 75)","getById calls addressRepository.findById(addressId).get() without checking presence, so a missing address triggers NoSuchElementException and returns 500 instead of the intended 404 ResourceNotFoundException."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(80, 90)","save() maps the request to an Address entity but never calls addressRepository.save(...). The address is never persisted and the returned response contains a null id, defeating the purpose of the API."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(99, 104)","getByUsername builds a native SQL string via direct concatenation of the username (""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '...'""). This is trivially exploitable for SQL injection and should use parameters or repository methods."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(163, 172)",delete(Long id) retrieves the user but never calls userRepository.delete(...). The API reports success while the user record remains in the database.
UserServiceImpl.java,"(176, 189)","checkLogin invokes userRepository.findByUsername(username).get(); when the username does not exist Optional.get throws NoSuchElementException, resulting in HTTP 500 instead of returning 401 via UnauthorizedException and defeating the constant-time comparison logic."
