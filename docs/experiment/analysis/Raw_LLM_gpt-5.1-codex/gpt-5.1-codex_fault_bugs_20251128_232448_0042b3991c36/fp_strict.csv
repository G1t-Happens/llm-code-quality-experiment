UserServiceImpl.java,"(99, 104)","getByUsername concatenates the username directly into a native SQL string (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + username + `'`), enabling SQL injection and bypassing parameter binding."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(120, 121)","The save method logs usernames together with the raw password string, leaking credentials into application logs and violating security best practices."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(162, 171)",delete(Long id) loads the user but never calls userRepository.delete(...); the method reports success without removing anything from the database.
UserServiceImpl.java,"(176, 189)",checkLogin calls userRepository.findByUsername(...).get() before validating credentials; when the username does not exist it throws NoSuchElementException (500) and the intended constant-time dummy hash/UnauthorizedException path is never executed.
