GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(1, 50)","Unhandled JPA exceptions: Only custom exceptions caught, hypothesizing omission fault (raw stack traces leak). Pass 1: Exception coverage - ConstraintViolationException propagates externally, medium probability exposing internals."
GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(1, 50)","Generic error responses: No specific messages, hypothesizing usability flaw. Pass 2: User experience view - vague 500 errors hinder debugging, low severity but poor service."
GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(1, 50)","Logging omissions: Exceptions logged without context, hypothesizing monitoring fault. Pass 3: Audit trail - missing user ID/timestamp reduces traceability, medium risk for compliance."
SecurityConfig.java,"(1, 100)","Weak password encoding: If BCrypt not configured properly, hypothesizing configuration fault (insecure hashing). Pass 1: Auth mechanism review - application.properties may lack strength settings, high probability of brute-force vulnerability."
SecurityConfig.java,"(1, 100)","CSRF disabled without justification: Exposes to attacks, hypothesizing intentional but risky design choice. Pass 2: Web security simulation - POST requests forgeable, medium probability in browser contexts."
SecurityConfig.java,"(1, 100)","JWT secret hardcoded or missing rotation: Hypothesizing operational fault (key exposure). Pass 3: Lifecycle analysis - no evidence of key management, high risk of token replay attacks."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(1, 100)","Incomplete error handling in delete: Repository delete doesn't check for dependent entities, hypothesizing design fault (cascading delete omission). Pass 3: Propagation path exploration - deleting address with linked users causes referential integrity failure, low-medium probability but catastrophic if data loss occurs."
AddressController.java,"(1, 50)","Path variable injection: ID parsing without validation, hypothesizing interaction fault (malformed IDs crash). Pass 2: Input tampering - non-numeric {id} in GET /addresses/{id} causes NumberFormatException, medium-high probability from malicious clients."
AddressController.java,"(1, 50)","No content-type negotiation: Assumes JSON, hypothesizing compatibility fault. Pass 3: Client diversity - XML requests fail, low probability but affects interoperability."
BaselineProjectApplication.java,"(1, 20)","No profile-specific config loading: Hardcoded properties, hypothesizing environment fault. Pass 1: Startup analysis - prod secrets in dev, low probability but security risk."
BaselineProjectApplication.java,"(1, 20)","Missing health checks: No actuator endpoints, hypothesizing monitoring omission. Pass 2: Operational simulation - failures undetected, medium impact on availability."
BaselineProjectApplication.java,"(1, 20)","No explicit error on startup faults: Silent fails, hypothesizing logging fault. Pass 3: Reliability view - bean init errors not surfaced, low but hinders debugging."
Address.java,"(1, 100)","Cascade delete on user-address relation: May orphan or delete unexpectedly, hypothesizing relationship design fault. Pass 1: ORM config review - unintended data loss on user delete, medium-high probability."
Address.java,"(1, 100)","No validation on address fields: Empty street allowed, hypothesizing constraint fault. Pass 2: Input validation - invalid geo data propagates to storage, high risk for mapping services."
Address.java,"(1, 100)","Enum AddressType not indexed: Slow queries on type, hypothesizing performance fault. Pass 3: Query optimization - large datasets slow filtering, low probability initially."
UserController.java,"(1, 50)","No rate limiting on endpoints: Open to DoS attacks, hypothesizing external malicious fault (flooding requests). Pass 2: Security adversarial view - repeated POST /users exhausts resources, medium probability without Spring Security config enhancements."
UserController.java,"(1, 50)","Response entity lacks HTTP status consistency: Assumes 200 for all, hypothesizing minor design flaw. Pass 3: Error propagation - service exceptions not mapped to 4xx/5xx, low probability but confuses clients."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(1, 100)","Inefficient query in listUsers: No pagination implemented in service, hypothesizing design flaw (performance degradation under load). Pass 3: Scalability perspective - with large datasets, full repository.findAll() causes memory overflow error, low probability in small-scale but high in operational growth."
application.properties,"(1, 50)","DB credentials exposed: If committed, hypothesizing human-made operational fault (secrets in repo). Pass 1: Config review - plaintext passwords leak on git, high probability of breach."
application.properties,"(1, 50)","Flyway baseline not set: Migration issues on existing DB, hypothesizing setup fault. Pass 2: Deployment simulation - version conflicts on init, medium probability."
application.properties,"(1, 50)","Logging level too verbose: Performance hit, hypothesizing tuning fault. Pass 3: Resource analysis - DEBUG in prod logs sensitive data, low but privacy risk."
V1__create_tables.sql,"(1, 20)","Missing indexes on foreign keys: Slow joins, hypothesizing schema design fault. Pass 1: DB structure analysis - user_id in address table unindexed causes query bottlenecks, high probability under load."
V1__create_tables.sql,"(1, 20)","No unique constraint on user email: Duplicates possible, hypothesizing integrity fault. Pass 2: Constraint simulation - concurrent inserts create inconsistent state, medium probability."
V1__create_tables.sql,"(1, 20)","Default charset not UTF8mb4: Emoji support lacking, hypothesizing compatibility fault. Pass 3: Internationalization view - non-ASCII data truncated, low but growing relevance."
User.java,"(1, 100)","No @Version for optimistic locking: Allows lost updates, hypothesizing entity design fault. Pass 1: Persistence analysis - concurrent modifications overwrite, high probability in multi-user scenarios."
User.java,"(1, 100)","Email uniqueness not enforced at entity: Relies on DB constraint, hypothesizing validation gap. Pass 2: Data integrity simulation - duplicate emails possible if migration fails, medium probability."
User.java,"(1, 100)","Missing audit fields: No createdAt/updatedAt, hypothesizing traceability omission. Pass 3: Compliance view - lacks timestamps for regulatory needs, low but potential legal fault."
