BaselineProjectApplication.java,"(1, 10)","No health check endpoint configuration; hypothesizes operational fault (missing actuator setup, line 5). Pass 1: Monitoring review - no /actuator/health for liveness."
BaselineProjectApplication.java,"(1, 10)","Hardcoded profiles, inflexible environments; hypothesizes design flaw (no @Profile or conditional beans, lines 1-10). Pass 2: Deployment sim - prod/test config mismatches."
BaselineProjectApplication.java,"(1, 10)","Missing graceful shutdown hook; hypothesizes interaction fault (abrupt termination on SIGTERM, line 8). Pass 3: Reliability branch - in-flight requests lost on restart."
AddressController.java,"(1, 40)","GET /addresses/{id} returns full user data without filtering, privacy violation; hypothesizes design flaw (over-exposure in response mapping, lines 10-20). Pass 1: Data flow analysis - sensitive user info leaked via address query."
AddressController.java,"(1, 40)","No CSRF protection on POST endpoints; hypothesizes security omission (SecurityConfig lacks CSRF config, lines 25-30). Pass 2: Web attack simulation - cross-site request forges address creation."
AddressController.java,"(1, 40)","Response caching not implemented, redundant DB hits; hypothesizes performance fault (no @Cacheable on service calls, lines 35-40). Pass 3: Scalability thought - high traffic leads to database overload."
User.java,"(1, 50)","No immutable fields for ID after creation, allows tampering; hypothesizes entity design fault (setter exposed on @Id, lines 15-25). Pass 1: State integrity check - runtime ID modification breaks JPA."
User.java,"(1, 50)","Lazy loading of addresses could cause N+1 query problem; hypothesizes interaction fault (default FetchType.LAZY without join fetch, lines 30-40). Pass 2: Query optimization sim - multiple DB calls per user load."
User.java,"(1, 50)","Missing validation constraints on entity fields; hypothesizes development omission (@NotNull absent, lines 5-15). Pass 3: Data consistency branch - null values persist to DB."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(1, 80)","No authorization check in address update, allows unauthorized modifications; hypothesizes security design fault (missing @PreAuthorize integration, lines 65-70). Pass 3: Adversarial condition - attacker updates any address without ownership validation."
GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(1, 30)","Unhandled JPA exceptions bubble up, inconsistent error responses; hypothesizes omission fault (no @ExceptionHandler for PersistenceException, lines 10-20). Pass 1: Exception coverage review - DB errors return 500 with traces."
GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(1, 30)","No logging of exceptions for auditing; hypothesizes operational fault (missing log.error calls, lines 15-25). Pass 2: Audit trail sim - security incidents untraceable."
GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(1, 30)","Generic error messages lack specificity for debugging; hypothesizes design choice fault (vague responses, lines 5-15). Pass 3: User feedback branch - developers can't diagnose from client-side errors."
V1__create_tables.sql,"(1, 20)","Missing indexes on foreign keys, slow joins; hypothesizes schema fault (no CREATE INDEX on user_id in address table, lines 10-15). Pass 1: DB performance analysis - query degradation under load."
V1__create_tables.sql,"(1, 20)","No default values or constraints for optional fields; hypothesizes development omission (nullable without NOT NULL where needed, lines 5-10). Pass 2: Data quality path - inconsistent null handling."
V1__create_tables.sql,"(1, 20)","Potential charset issues if not UTF8 specified; hypothesizes configuration fault (default collation, lines 1-5). Pass 3: Internationalization test - non-ASCII data corruption."
Address.java,"(1, 40)","Bidirectional relationship not properly managed, potential infinite recursion in toString/equals; hypothesizes software fault (no defensive coding in getters, lines 20-30). Pass 1: Serialization analysis - JSON mapping stack overflow."
Address.java,"(1, 40)","No unique constraint on address fields, duplicates possible; hypothesizes schema design flaw (missing @Column(unique=true), lines 10-20). Pass 2: Integrity propagation - multiple identical addresses for same user."
Address.java,"(1, 40)","Enum AddressType not validated at entity level; hypothesizes latent fault (invalid enum value insertion, lines 25-35). Pass 3: Input anomaly test - string mismatch causes enum cast error."
SecurityConfig.java,"(1, 60)","Weak password encoding if BCrypt not properly configured; hypothesizes configuration fault (potential default weak hasher, lines 20-30). Pass 1: Auth mechanism review - stored passwords vulnerable to cracking."
SecurityConfig.java,"(1, 60)","Session management allows indefinite sessions without timeout; hypothesizes operational fault (no max-session-timeout in config, lines 40-50). Pass 2: Session hijack path - idle sessions exploited post-logout."
SecurityConfig.java,"(1, 60)","CORS policy too permissive, allows unauthorized origins; hypothesizes misconfiguration (broad * wildcard, lines 10-20). Pass 3: Adversarial origin test - malicious site accesses API."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(1, 100)","Inefficient database query in getAllUsers without pagination support; hypothesizes design flaw (lack of offset/limit params, lines 20-30). Pass 3: Performance tree-of-thought - large datasets cause memory overflow and slow response times."
UserController.java,"(1, 50)","Inadequate error response in exception handling, leaks stack traces; hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (GlobalExceptionHandler not fully integrated, lines 40-45). Pass 2: Error propagation sim - internal exceptions expose sensitive info to client."
UserController.java,"(1, 50)","Missing input sanitization for user fields, SQL injection risk if not handled by JPA; hypothesizes latent interaction fault (relies solely on @Valid, lines 15-25). Pass 3: Malicious input branch - crafted payloads could bypass validation."
