E016,UserServiceImpl.java,"(103, 109)","(103, 105)",critical,critical,"Username parameter is concatenated directly into SQL, allowing an attacker to retrieve data via SQL injections","Raw SQL concatenation in getByUsername enables SQL injection vulnerability (Security: injection), allowing arbitrary database access and data exfiltration via malicious username parameters."
E013,UserServiceImpl.java,"(182, 182)","(182, 182)",critical,high,Calling .get() on findByUsername() causes a NoSuchElementException (HTTP 500) on every login attempt with a non-existent username instead of returning the intended HTTP 401 Unauthorized,"NullPointerException risk in checkLogin when userRepository.findByUsername returns empty Optional (Reliability: fault tolerance), causing application crash on non-existent username login attempts."
E015,AddressServiceImpl.java,"(65, 65)","(67, 67)",critical,high,Replacing .orElseThrow() with .get() in AddressServiceImpl.getById() causes an unhandled NoSuchElementException and returns HTTP 500 instead of the proper HTTP 404 whenever a client requests a non-existent address ID,"NullPointerException in getById when addressRepository.findById returns empty Optional (Reliability: fault tolerance), crashing the application without proper error handling."

Frontend developers not know which data to provide,"Mismatched validation field name 'someValue' instead of 'street' (Functional suitability: correctness), causing validation bypass and data integrity issues in address creation."
