E002,UserServiceImpl.java,"(164, 174)",critical,Missing delete call in the repository/data access layer
E003,AddressServiceImpl.java,"(76, 88)",critical,Missing save call in the repository/data access layer
E004,UserServiceImpl.java,"(75, 80)",high,Loading all users before pagination and transform them to DTOs – wrong order
E007,LoggingConfig.java,"(237, 237)",medium,"Appender and log level are set on ROOT_LOGGER, affecting all components and modules globally"
E008,LoggingConfig.java,"(96, 97)",high,"Sets the timezone globally for the entire JVM instead of only for the logger, potentially affecting other modules, libraries, and scheduling operations"
E009,AddressController.java,"(42, 42)",high,Incorrect MIME type in controller. The API expects JSON but text/plain is declared. Clients sending JSON may fail
E010,UserController.java,"(47, 47)",high,"The create() endpoint does not validate the UserRequest DTO. Invalid input (e.g., missing required fields) can lead to a 500 Internal Server Error instead of a clear client-facing error"
E012,AddressController.java,"(48, 48)",medium,"The update() Endpoint uses PUT, but business logic uses partial field updates. API is hard to use correctly and does not convey the intended behavior clearly to clients"
E014,SecurityConfig.java,"(107, 110)",critical,"Removing all validation in createSecretKey causes the entire Spring Boot application to fail to start (throwing an uncaught exception during context initialization) whenever jwt.secret is missing, empty, malformed, or too short"
E017,UserServiceImpl.java,"(119, 119)",critical,"Logs include user passwords in plaintext, potentially exposing them in logs accessible to operators or attackers"
E019,AddressController.java,"(21, 25)",low,"Tight coupling between controller and service. This creates tight coupling, making testing and swapping implementations harder"
E021,UserServiceImpl.java,"(206, 206)",low,"Method named 'do_Some_Stuff()' uses a vague, non-descriptive name that hides its intent, severely reducing code readability and analysability"
E022,LoggingConfig.java,"(54, 55)",high,"The default log file name contains characters valid on Linux but invalid on Windows (e.g., application:errors.log). This prevents installation/running on Windows"
E023,LoggingConfig.java,"(51, 52)",high,Hardcoded Linux-specific log directory. Running this on Windows or another OS will fail or move to an unpredictable location unless manually changed
E024,LoggingConfig.java,"(193, 193)",medium,Hardcoded file path separator may cause portability issues across different operating systems
