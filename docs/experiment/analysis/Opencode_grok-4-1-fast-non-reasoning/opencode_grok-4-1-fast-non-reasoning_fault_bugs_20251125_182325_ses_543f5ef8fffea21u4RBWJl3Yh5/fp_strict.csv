application.properties,"(22, 22)",spring.jpa.show-sql=true exposes SQL queries in logs (line 23) hypothesizes nonmalicious configuration fault; medium-probability info leak via log access; propagates to reconnaissance for injection attacks
UserServiceImpl.java,"(25, 26)",Inconsistent PasswordEncoder usage in save: creates new BCryptPasswordEncoder() instead of injected bean (line 25) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (inconsistency); low-probability mismatch if bean config differs; propagates to authentication failure
UserServiceImpl.java,"(67, 70)",Incomplete delete in delete: finds user but omits repository.delete(existingUserEntity) (lines 66-72) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (omission: missing persistence delete call); dormant fault activates on delete requests; propagates to content failure (ghost users persist)
UserServiceImpl.java,"(81, 82)",NullPointerException in checkLogin: userRepository.findByUsername(username).get() assumes non-null (line 81) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (omission: missing Optional handling); medium-probability activation via non-existent username; propagates to erratic failure (NPE crash)
UserServiceImpl.java,"(102, 103)",SQL injection vulnerability in getByUsername: raw username concatenation in native query 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = \'' + username + '\'' (lines 102-103) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (design flaw: unsafe string interpolation); high-probability activation via malicious username=' OR 1=1--'; propagates to unauthorized data access failure
V2__insert_data.sql,"(3, 12)",Hardcoded production passwords in migration: identical/weak hashes exposed (lines 3-12) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (security omission); dormant until DB dump; high propagation risk (mass account compromise)
