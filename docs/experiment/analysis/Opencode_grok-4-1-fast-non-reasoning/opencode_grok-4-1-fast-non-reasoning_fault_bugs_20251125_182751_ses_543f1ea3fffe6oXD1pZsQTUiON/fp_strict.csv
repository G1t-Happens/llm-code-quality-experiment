application.properties,"(22, 24)","spring.jpa.show-sql=true in production config (line 23) leaks schema/queries hypothesizes nonmalicious configuration fault (debug mode exposure), medium-probability reconnaissance aid for attackers"
V2__insert_data.sql,"(1, 12)","Hardcoded production passwords in migration script (lines 3-12) hypothesizes malicious operational fault risk (credential exposure in source control), high-probability compromise if repo leaked → full system access failure"
UserServiceImpl.java,"(25, 26)","Redundant PasswordEncoder instantiation in save/update (lines 25,52) instead of injected instance hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (resource inefficiency), minor performance degradation under high load"
UserServiceImpl.java,"(67, 69)","Constructor injection violation: @Autowired on constructor (line 62) despite DI guidelines specifying constructor injection without @Autowired hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (inconsistency with coding standards), low propagation risk but indicates systemic quality control fault"
UserServiceImpl.java,"(81, 94)","NullPointerException risk in checkLogin: userRepository.findByUsername(username).get() (line 81) assumes Optional presence without orElse/orElseThrow hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (unchecked repository return), medium-probability NPE error → erratic failure under non-existent username"
UserServiceImpl.java,"(102, 103)","SQL injection vulnerability in getByUsername: raw username concatenation in native query 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = \'' + username + '\'' (lines 102-103) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (design flaw: failure to use parameterized query), high-probability activation via malicious username input → SQL error or unauthorized data access failure"
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(40, 45)","Constructor @Autowired usage violates DI guidelines (line 40) hypothesizes nonmalicious development fault (standards non-compliance), low direct risk but flags potential for field injection faults elsewhere"
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(86, 89)","Missing repository save in save(): maps to entity/response but never persists (lines 86-89) hypothesizes critical nonmalicious development fault (transactional omission), data loss failure - addresses never saved to DB"
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(139, 146)","Potential NPE in enforceAddressOwnership: address.getUser() unchecked before getId() (line 141) hypothesizes dormant nonmalicious development fault (defensive programming omission), low-probability if FK enforced but possible under DB corruption → erratic failure"
