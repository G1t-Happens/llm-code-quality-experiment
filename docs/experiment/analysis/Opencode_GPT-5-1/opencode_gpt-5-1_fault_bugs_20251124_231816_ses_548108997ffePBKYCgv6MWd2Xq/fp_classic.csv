GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(47, 51)","Nonmalicious human-made development fault with potential information disclosure: handleMalformedJson(HttpMessageNotReadableException) (lines 47–51) returns an ErrorResponse message concatenating ex.getMostSpecificCause().getMessage(). Parser messages may include internal class names, field paths, or unexpected input fragments, which can leak implementation details or sensitive snippets back to clients. This is a dormant confidentiality risk that may activate when malformed JSON is sent maliciously for reconnaissance."
SecurityConfig.java,"(66, 67)","Nonmalicious human-made configuration/development fault around JWT secret handling: SecurityConfig.securityFilterChain plus createSecretKey(String base64Secret) (lines 66–67 and 107–109) assume jwt.secret is a Base64-encoded key. If operators follow typical documentation patterns and configure a raw string (not Base64), Base64.getDecoder().decode(jwtSecret) will throw IllegalArgumentException at startup, preventing the application from booting (halt failure). This is a latent configuration fault whose activation depends on deployment practices and documentation clarity."
