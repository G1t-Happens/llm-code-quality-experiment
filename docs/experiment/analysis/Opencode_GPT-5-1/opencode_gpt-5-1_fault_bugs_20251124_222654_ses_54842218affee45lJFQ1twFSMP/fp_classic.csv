GlobalExceptionHandler.java,"(47, 51)","Nonmalicious design fault: handleMalformedJson(HttpMessageNotReadableException) echoes ex.getMostSpecificCause().getMessage() directly to clients, potentially leaking low-level parser/internal details that aid attackers in crafting malformed inputs."
User.java,"(68, 77)","Nonmalicious design fault: User.equals/hashCode rely solely on id, so two transient User instances with null ids compare equal and share the same hash, which can corrupt Sets/Maps and cause subtle persistence bugs when handling unsaved entities."
Address.java,"(104, 113)","Nonmalicious design fault: Address.equals/hashCode also rely only on id, making multiple transient Address instances with null ids equal and hash-colliding, which can break collection semantics and lead to lost or overwritten addresses before persistence."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(80, 83)","Nonmalicious development fault: in save(Long userId, AddressRequest), the error log message on missing user is copy-pasted as ""<-- getById, User with userId {} not found"", which mislabels the failing operation and complicates operational debugging."
application.properties,"(21, 24)","Nonmalicious configuration/design fault: spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update is enabled alongside explicit Flyway migrations (V1__create_tables.sql, V2__insert_data.sql), allowing Hibernate to mutate the schema at runtime and drift from the migration baseline, jeopardizing reproducibility and long-term schema integrity."
