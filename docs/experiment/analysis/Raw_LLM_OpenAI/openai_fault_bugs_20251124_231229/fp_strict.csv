UserServiceImpl.java,"(181, 189)","Null dereference and authentication bypass: checkLogin() calls userRepository.findByUsername(username).get() without checking if user is present, leading to NoSuchElementException if user does not exist. This is a nonmalicious development fault (omission, software, internal). Could cause halt failure (500 error) instead of proper 401 Unauthorized. Also, password check is performed after this dereference, so DUMMY_HASH is not used for non-existent users, undermining timing attack mitigation."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(118, 132)","Sensitive data exposure in logs: save() logs both username and password in plaintext at DEBUG level. This is a nonmalicious development fault (implementation, software, internal). Could lead to confidentiality failure if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(136, 159)","Sensitive data exposure in logs: update() logs username and potentially other sensitive fields at DEBUG level. This is a nonmalicious development fault (implementation, software, internal). Could lead to confidentiality failure if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties."
AddressServiceImpl.java,"(87, 89)","Address entity not persisted: save() creates Address entity from DTO but does not persist it (missing addressRepository.save(addressEntity)). This is a nonmalicious development fault (omission, software, internal, dormant until address creation is attempted). Could cause content failure (address not saved in DB, but response returned as if it was)."
