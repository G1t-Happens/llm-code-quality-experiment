UserServiceImpl.java,"(118, 118)","Sensitive data exposure in logs: save() (line 118) logs plaintext password in debug message. This is a nonmalicious development fault (omission, software, internal, development phase). Propagation: latent error; may lead to credential exposure if logs are accessed. Prevention: never log sensitive data such as passwords."
UserServiceImpl.java,"(55, 55)","Password double-encoding: UserMapper.updateUserEntityFromUserRequest() (see UserMapper.java line 55) encodes password twice (passwordEncoder.encode(passwordEncoder.encode(dto.password()))). This is a nonmalicious development fault (design/implementation, software, internal, development phase). Propagation: latent error; user will not be able to log in after password update. Prevention: encode password only once."
